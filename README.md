GARAGE92
### 1.1 Introduction to system 
Garage92 is a web-based applications for vehicle service management system. the core concept of project is to make booking of vehicle service.

### 1.2 Existing system & its limitation
In traditional service booking for to book a vehicle service costumer has to visit garage every time to his/her appointment of vehicle service sometimes appointment reached to its limits and have to close the appointment service or he/she has to come tomorrow to book their vehicle service again but costumer is didn't aware of that and this leads to cancellation of appointment or delays when costumer comes late to book an appointment for vehicle service
1) Costumer has to visit garage every time to book their vehicle service 
2) To enquire time of the store or any enquiry related to servicing of vehicle still has to visit garage
3) If appointment reached to its limit them costumer have to come again tomorrow for next day booking s
4) Costumer has to carry cash to pay for servicing means there is no flexibility in the payment mod

 After the problem statement is clearly understood the next step is checking the feasibility of the system. It is necessary to determine whether the outcome of the preliminary investigation is feasible. It is both necessary and prudent to evaluate the feasibility of a project at the earliest possible time. A feasibility study is a test of a system proposal regarding its workability, impact on the organization, ability to meet user needs, and effective use of resources. Thus, when a new application is proposed, it normally goes through a feasibility study and is approved for development. For any project to be successful, there is a need for an effective feasibility study. The problem is worth solving. This software has been tested for various feasibility criterions from various points of views.
1. Operational feasibility <br />
2. Usability Feasibility <br />
3. Economic feasibility  <br />
4. Schedule Feasibility <br />
5. Technical Feasibility <br />

# Feasibility study
 
## 2.1.1 Operational Feasibility: 
Operational feasibility is the measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development.
A vehicle service management system. In Operational feasibility the customer doesn't need to go to the vehicle service centre every time for booking through our application. The customers can book it anywhere even in a remote location and our client’s customers can fulfil their requirements such as getting the types of service we provide, whichever time can select for booking means flexibility, can ask any query through enquiry module.



## 2.1.2 Usability Feasibility:
Usability is design factor that affect the user experience of operating the application device and navigating the application for its intended purpose in our user interface design we will provide appointment request form to book service of vehicle as per his/her convenience, for enquiry related query our system will provide enquiry request form so user can ask any query to admin and our interface will be easy to use and navigate.

## 2.1.3 Schedule Feasibility: 
Schedule feasibility is the degree to which a deadline for a strategy, plan, project or process is realistic and achievable.
In this project, the project schedule is interpreted in the form of a Gantt chart for identifying schedule feasibility. The following chart depicts the time period of each task in the project units have taken, as compared to real time. This will ensure that the project is being completed successfully.

## 2.1.4 Technical Feasibility: 
A technical feasibility study assesses the details of how you intend to deliver a product or service to customers. It's the logistical or tactical plan of how your business will produce, store, deliver, and track its products or services.
These are the main technologies used in our project
HTML 5, CSS, MySQL, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap etc..
They are readily available and the technical skills are feasible

## 2.1.5 Economic Feasibility: 
The economic feasibility step of business development is that period during which a break-even financial model of the business venture is developed based on all costs associated with taking the product from idea to market and achieving sales sufficient to satisfy debt or investment requirements.
(Cost benefit Analysis) Being a web application which allows users to book an appointment at their convenience, this website will have a hosting charge. No cost will be charged from the customers who have booked an appointment to analyse the condition.

### 6.1 Introduction 
Testing is the process of evaluating a software to detect difference between given and expected output. Also, to access the feature and quality of the software. Testing is the process that should be done during the development process. In other words, testing is verification and validation process, where verification means to make sure the product satisfies the condition imposed at the start of the development phase and validation means to make sure the product satisfies the requirement at the development phase. Testing is one of the major areas wherein it becomes easy in understanding the behavior of the software created.    

### 6.2 Manual testing 
Manual Testing is a type of software testing in which test cases are executed manually by a tester without using any automated tools. The purpose of Manual Testing is to identify the bugs, issues, and defects in the software application. Manual software testing is the most primitive technique of all testing types and it helps to find critical bugs in the software application. with manual testing a testing manually conducts tests on the software by following a set of pre-defined test cases

### 6.2.1 Unit testing  
Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object. In this project unit testing was done at every intermediate module level.

### 6.2.2 Integration testing
Integration testing is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated
Once all the module were developed and integrated together, integration testing was performed on this web application as a whole.
